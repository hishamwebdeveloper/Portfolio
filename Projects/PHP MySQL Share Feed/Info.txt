Design Pattern: MVC

Languages: PHP, MYSQL, HTML5, CSS

Summary of project: A share system where people can post things.

Purpose of project: Learn MVC and practice languages used.

To do: Fix system allowing multiple logins and adding a delete function.

Status of project: CSS wise I think its ok for a mini project.
Should probably take sometime to solve multiple logins since I have never tried it yet.


To Check:
- Is it better to have seperate views without main? It's pretty annoying to switch pages to fix stuff.
- What is the best/correct way to add more css for seperate views?
