Design Pattern: Front controller

Languages: PHP, JS, MYSQL, HTML5, CSS, AJAX

Summary of project: Chat system with accounts.

Purpose of project: To learn AJAX.

To do: Fix system allowing multiple logins and css.

Status of project: Just need to improve CSS and make chat pretty.
Probably won't continue. If I did it would be to try longblob and uploading mysql images.
Its fruitless to continue with an ajax chat system.



*Note: Not sure which but I think I have to learn comet and/or web sockets to create a chat system.
When I inspect browser for popular browser systems they don't use ajax with set interval.
If they did it would a server overload.
